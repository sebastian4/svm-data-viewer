In this example we are going to program an MVC (Model View Controller) webstore
with customers, products and orders.

The application is using the directory layout that is recommended by Sencha.

This is the schema we try to realize with ExtJS:

Textual:
--------

- One customer can make multiple orders.
- Each order can consist of multiple products.

Schema:
-------

             Customer       {id, firstname, lastname}
                |  1
                |
                |  n
              Order         {id, customer_id, date}
                |  n
                |
                |  n
             Products       {id, name, description, price}

In ExtJS we cannot realize the schema for the same reason we cannot realize this
schema in SQL: We need an additional association:

             Customer       {id, firstname, lastname}
                |  1
                |
                |  n
              Order         {id, customer_id, date}
                |  1
                |
                |  n
            OrderItem       {id, order_id, product_id}
                |  n
                |
                |  1
             Products       {id, name, description, price}

This way we decouple the Order from the products

Happy coding,
